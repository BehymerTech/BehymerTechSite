      <description>Introduction: I&amp;rsquo;m Joe Behymer. I have been in the technology industry in many different roles since 2006. I have been a technican, a systems administrator, and even spent 4 years teaching high school IT.
I have noticed that it is getting more and more difficult to find reliable, local support without spending thousands of dollars just to get someone onsite. I started Behymer Tech to be your first stop on your search for technology support.</description>
