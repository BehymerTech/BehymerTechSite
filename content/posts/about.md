## Introduction:
I'm Joe Behymer. I have been in the technology industry in many different roles since 2006. I have been a technican, a systems administrator, and even spent 4 years teaching high school IT.  

I have noticed that it is getting more and more difficult to find reliable, local support without spending thousands of dollars just to get someone onsite. I started Behymer Tech to be your first stop on your search for technology support. 
## My promise:
- If I can't do the work, I will recommend someone who can.
- I will always be the most affordable professional option available. If you find someone certified offering support cheaper, I will match it. 
- I will never sell you on a solution I wouldn't use myself.
- You own your equipment and network. You are never locked in to support with me and always have the accounts and documentation. I am a guest in your house and will leave you the keys.
